# 📈 Stockify

> ### AI-Powered Portfolio Intelligence Platform

Stockify is a full-stack MERN application that helps investors **understand their portfolio instead of just tracking it**.

Unlike traditional stock market platforms that primarily display charts and numbers, Stockify leverages **Artificial Intelligence** to transform portfolio data into personalized, actionable insights. It analyzes investment behavior, evaluates portfolio health, identifies potential risks, and provides recommendations tailored to each investor's financial profile.

The platform consists of two major AI modules:

### 📊 AI Portfolio Analyzer
An intelligent portfolio analysis engine that automatically evaluates a user's investments by calculating:

- Portfolio Health Score
- Total Investment & Current Portfolio Value
- Overall Profit/Loss
- Portfolio Diversification
- Sector-wise Exposure
- Concentration Risk
- Risk Level Assessment
- Best & Worst Performing Holdings
- Asset Allocation
- AI-generated Portfolio Insights & Recommendations

Every buy or sell transaction dynamically updates the portfolio, ensuring that the analysis always reflects the latest investment data.

### 🧠 Personalized Investment Advisor

Stockify also features a personalized AI advisor that first understands the investor before providing recommendations.

It considers factors such as:

- Age
- Occupation
- Income Range
- Investment Goals
- Risk Tolerance

- Preferred Sectors
- Investment Preference

Based on this information, the AI generates a comprehensive investment report containing:
